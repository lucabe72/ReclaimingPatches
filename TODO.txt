Check reviews to v2 to see if something is still missing

Patch 0001:

This is more ugly, I know. It makes probably sense though if we then need it in
the next patch. But you are saying the contrary (we don't actually need it), so
in that case we might just want to add a comment here explaining why we handle
the "task is dying" case together with "task is going to sleep" (so that I
don't forget? :).
